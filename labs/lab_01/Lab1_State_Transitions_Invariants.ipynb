    "  The first * that is placed correctly due to the calculations completed using leading spaces. The variable begins and starts with a foundation of the midpoint. As the row moves further from the midpoint, the leading spaces variable increase by 1. Therefore if there is a row that is two rows away from the midpoint, the leading spaces will be two. This calculation ensures that the * will create the pyramid pattern in the diamond. \n",

    "  The second * is placed using the calculation of inner spaces. The variable inner spaces begins with the value of -1. Since the spaces need to increase by tweo, each row that increases, the value increases by 2. Therefore for row 2 there will be 1 sapce in the middle to create the pyramid space on the other side of the diamond and make the space symmetrical. \n",
    "- Explain why the “tip row” (one `*`) is a necessary special case.\n",

    "1. For each part, list the **state variables** you actually used in your code.\n",
    "For part 1, the state variables used were row, mid, dist, leading_spaces, and inner_spaces. For part 2, the state variables were letter_count, word_count, and sentence_count. Lastly, for part 3, the state variables include shift_norm, encrypt_map, and decrypt_map. \n",
    "2. For each part, identify one **transition rule** you relied on most.\n",
    "For part 1, specifically part 1b, the transition rule that I relied most on was the dist = abs(mid-row) to determine the rows position from the midpoint and the value of leading_spaces and inner_spaces. For part 2, the main transition was using .isalpha() to check each character and variable to ensure the count is correct. Lastly, in part 3, the transition rule I most relied on was the encryption mapping by replacing all letters with the shift_norm variable. \n",
    "3. For each part, name one **invariant** that helped you debug.\n",
    "For part 1, an important invariant that helped debug was that every row must fit within the small total width and was centered around the midpoint. In part 2, an important invariant was that letter count only increase with alphabetic characters and sentence count only increases with punctuation that is stated. Lastly, an invariant in part 3 that was influential was the bijection mentioned in the explanation on part 3. This ensured that each letter was paired and match with only one encryption character and vice versa. \n",
    "4. Describe one place where a small bug would violate an invariant and how you would notice.\n",
    "In part 1, a small bug would be if the number of inner_spaces violates the fixed width and causes the diamond and pattern to print unsymmetrical, being a tell tale sign. In part 2, a bug that could occur is using the .isalpha() to count sentences would violate the idea that only punctuation ends a sentence, this would be noticable as the sentence count would be incorrect. Lastly, a bug in part 3 would be if the decryption violates the bijection invariant. A way to check this is by noticing the decrypted message will not return the same encrypted message. "
